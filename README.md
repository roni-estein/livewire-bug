# Weird Livewire Bug

Noticed this while hacking on livewire. I've added all the plug-ins from the original project.

To install, run composer install
and then yarn.

once it's compiled down the error is right on the initial view.
At the bottom you'll see the odd behavior.

Comment out the foreach loop and uncomment the livewire calls and you will see the same items without the bug

If anyone is able to make a more controlled component idea with this please let me know.
